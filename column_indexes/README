= Column Indexes

Column Indexes is a plugin that provides an option to create an index when
defining the column in a migration or via <code>add_column</code>.

Set the option <code>:index</code> to <code>true</code> to define an index.

  create_table :users do |t|
    t.string :role,   :index => true
    ...
  end

By default the index will be non-unique; the option <code>:unique</code>
can be set to <code>true</code> for a unique index.  As a convenient
shorthand, you can simply set <code>:index</code> to <code>:unique</code>.
Thus the following are equivalent:

  t.string :userid, :index => true, :unique => true
  t.string :userid, :index => :unique

You can also define a multi-column index by using the option
<code>:index_with</code> to list the additional column or columns:

    create_table :users do |t|
      t.integer :group_id
      t.integer :member_number, :index_with => :group_id, :unique => true
      t.integer :country_code
      t.integer :area_code
      t.string :local_phone,    :index_with => [:country_code, :area_code], :unique => true
    end

A multi-column index is symmetric in its columns and the index isn't
created until after all columns are defined--so it's your stylistic choice
as to which column to define the index on vs. which to list as the
<code>:index_with</code> targets.

By default the index will be named after the table and the first column
name as per <code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::add_index</code>.  Use
the <code>:index_name</code> to specify a different name:

  t.string :zipcode,    :index => true, :index_name => 'by_zip_code'

For PostgreSQL the index will be case sensitive by default, but you can
make it case insensitive (as per Redhillonrails Core) by specifying
<code>:case_sensitive</code> as <code>false</code>

  t.string :email,      :index => true, :case_sensitive => false

The same options are available for <code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::add_column</code>
